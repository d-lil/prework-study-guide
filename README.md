# Prework Study Guide

## Description

- A website for a quick and easy study reference
- Wanted to create a central location to find all topics studied in prework as well as one that can be adjusted/added to as needed
- Helped to create an organized and easy to use study guide instead of loose bits of info floating around in different folders on the computer and notebooks irl
- Doing this helped me learn the basics of website design and Git, while also putting in good practice with the task manager aka GitBash

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

An easily naviagated page that directs you to each topic that was used in prework (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git) as well as notes on each of those topics in order to help learn and review each topic. If the DevTools console is open on the console, you can see the JS running. It lists topics learned and will choose one topic to study first.
